# 📊 Maths Project: Visualizing Coin Toss Distribution

## 📌 Overview
This project visualizes the probability distribution of tossing 9 fair coins simultaneously for an increasing number of trials. The results are plotted on a **LineChart** to analyze the frequency of different tail counts and observe the emerging distribution.

## 🔍 How It Works
1. **Toss 9 fair coins simultaneously** and record the number of tails in each trial.
2. Repeat the process for multiple trials: 5, 10, 20, 30, 40, ..., 100, 200, ..., 1000, etc.
3. **Plot a graph** of the number of tails (Count) vs. the frequency of occurrences for all trials combined.
4. Observe the shape of the distribution as the number of trials increases.

## 📈 Observations
- As the number of trials increases, the distribution starts resembling a well-known probability distribution.
- Can you recognize which distribution it follows?

## ✨ Features
- Simulates multiple trials of tossing 9 coins.
- Dynamically records and visualizes results.
- Uses a **LineChart** to display the frequency of each tail count.
- Allows users to experiment with different numbers of trials.

## 🛠 Technologies Used
- **Programming Language:** (Specify language, e.g., Python, Java, Flutter, etc.)
- **Graphing Library:** (Specify, e.g., Matplotlib, Chart.js, Flutter Charts, etc.)

## 🚀 Installation & Usage
1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/MathsProject.git
   cd MathsProject
   ```
2. **Install dependencies** (if any):
   ```sh

   ```

## 📊 Example Output
*(Include a screenshot of the generated graph here.)*

## 🔮 Future Enhancements
- Allow users to customize the number of coins tossed.
- Add interactive elements to explore different trial sizes.
- Compare the results with theoretical probability distributions.
