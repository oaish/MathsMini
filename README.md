# 📊 Maths Project: Visualizing Coin Toss Distribution

## 📌 Overview
This project visualizes the probability distribution of tossing 9 fair coins simultaneously for an increasing number of trials. The results are plotted on a **LineChart** to analyze the frequency of different tail counts and observe the emerging distribution.

## 🔍 How It Works
1. **Toss 9 fair coins simultaneously** and record the number of tails in each trial.
2. Repeat the process for multiple trials: 5, 10, 20, 30, 40, ..., 100, 200, ..., 1000, etc.
3. **Plot a graph** of the number of tails (Count) vs. the frequency of occurrences for all trials combined.
4. Observe the shape of the distribution as the number of trials increases.

## 📈 Observations
- As the number of trials increases, the distribution starts resembling a well-known probability distribution.
- Can you recognize which distribution it follows?

## ✨ Features
- Simulates multiple trials of tossing 9 coins.
- Dynamically records and visualizes results.
- Uses a **LineChart** to display the frequency of each tail count.
- Allows users to experiment with different numbers of trials.

## 🛠 Technologies Used
- **Programming Language:** Flutter
- **Graphing Library:** Flutter Charts
